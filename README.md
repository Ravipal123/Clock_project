## About The Project
Introducing our cutting-edge analog website, having features as : 
An Analog clock that is running anticlockwise, and counts down from the current time (the time when the screen is opened) to 120 minutes earlier.
A slider to control the speed of the clock hands. The slider should allow users to increase or decrease the speed of the clock hands.
A share button that generates a unique URL when clicked. The URL allows another user to view the clock and the slider on the same page with the exact same slider configuration as when the share button was clicked.
